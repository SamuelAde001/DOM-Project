# DOM-Project on Shopping cart

- I built a basic shopping cart that basically has already built in items
- you can be able to increase the quantity of the items
- you can decrease the quantity of the items
- everytime you increase or decrease it would have an ipact on the total price of all the items
- you can also like an item with a heart
- and delete an item from the cart
